node.js scripts do download and sqlize the Romanian Orthodox Bible from biblia-bartolomeu.ro
deliverable: SQL DB with the normalized Bible

Steps I did to SQLize the bible:
1. Run the CreateDb script which creates the schema and inserts the Testaments data.
But not it's out of date because I am using the SqliteBrowser to alter the schema.

2. Run the GetBooks scripts which inserts the Books data

3. Run the DownloadChapters script which downloads the chapters table of contents HTML
locally

4. Run the ParseLocalChapters in order to insert the Chapters data

5. Run IterateOverChaptersAndInsertVersets in order to:
- insert the versets in the Versets table
- insert the notes in the TemporaryNotes table
- insert the links in the TemporaryLinks table
The current problem is that the data in the TemporaryNotes is encoded, I might have to redo that,
and also parse whatever links are present in the temporary notes.
