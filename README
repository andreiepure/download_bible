node.js scripts do download and sqlize the Romanian Orthodox Bible from biblia-bartolomeu.ro
deliverable: SQL DB with the normalized Bible

Steps I did to SQLize the bible:
1. Run the CreateDb script which creates the schema and inserts the Testaments data.
But not it's out of date because I am using the SqliteBrowser to alter the schema.

2. Run the GetBooks scripts which inserts the Books data

3. Run the DownloadChapters script which downloads the chapters table of contents HTML
locally

4. Run the ParseLocalChapters in order to insert the Chapters data

5. [TODO] Insert the versets, notes and verset links, but I it's too much data for one go.

How to debug:

The repl command allows code to be evaluated remotely.
The next command steps to the next line.
The cont command will continue execution until next breakpoint.
